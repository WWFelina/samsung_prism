Smart home
Alexa can integrate with loads of smart home platforms, such as SmartThings, Philips Hue, Wink, Insteon, Lutron, Belkin WeMo and many more. Some require you to enable skills, and some don't. 

Here is a selection of the commands you can use for controlling your smart home, although there are dozens more.

Turn lights on or off: "Alexa, turn on the lights" or "Alexa, turn off the living room lights."
Dim the lights: "Alexa, dim the lights to 50 percent."
Change the color of the lights: "Alexa, make the living room lights red" or " Alexa, turn the lights to soft white."
Change the color temperature of the lights: "Alexa, make the kitchen lights a little warmer."
Adjust temperature: "Alexa, raise the temperature 1 degree."
Set temperature: "Alexa, set the temperature to 72."
Lock your doors: "Alexa, lock my back door."
Close your garage door: "Alexa, ask Garageio to close my garage."
Discover smart home devices: "Alexa, discover my devices."
Use IFTTT recipes: "Alexa, trigger [IFTTT recipe]."
Activate a scene (limited to Control4, Insteon, Lutron CasÃ©ta Wireless, Philips Hue, SmartThings and Wink): "Alexa, turn on Movie Time" or "Alexa, turn on Bedtime."
Control GE appliances with the Geneva skill: "Alexa, tell Geneva to preheat my oven to 400 degrees" or "Alexa, ask Geneva if my laundry is dry."

Control the TV via Harmony hub: "Alexa, turn on the TV" or "Alexa, turn on Netflix."
The Polk Command Bar has Alexa embedded in its soundbar that provides great sound quality.
Saying "Alexa, run Away Mode" produces conversations to scare off any potential burglars.
Alexa Guard can help keep your home safe by alerting you when it picks up the sounds of smoke alarms or breaking glass. It works with the Amazon smart door bell, a Ring and an ADT security system. To set this feature, simply say "Alexa, I'm leaving."
Bluetooth
Pair a Bluetooth device: "Alexa, pair" or "Alexa, Bluetooth."
Connect to a Bluetooth device: "Alexa, connect to my phone."
Disconnect from a Bluetooth device: "Alexa, disconnect from my phone."
Profiles and user accounts
Switch profiles: "Alexa, switch accounts."
Check which profile is active: "Alexa, which profile is this?"
Skills
Skills are third-party applications for Alexa speakers. They allow you to connect third-party software and hardware to your speaker, as well as play games and add different news sources to your Flash Briefing. Originally, they had to be enabled before you could use them, but Amazon has since made that process automatic (just ask for the Skill and it will enable when it's used).

Use a skill: "Alexa, open Earplay."
Find kid's skills: "Alexa, what kid's skills do you have?"
Enable skills: "Alexa, enable Jeopardy!"
Disable skills: "Alexa, disable Domino's."
Bartender skill gives you access to more than 12,000 cocktail recipes: "Alexa, open the bartender."
Cortana
Microsoft's Cortana is available as a skill, as well. But rather than just being a skill, it opens the door to a completely separate digital assistant through your Alexa speakers. 

Once you've added the skill, enabled permissions and connected your Microsoft and Amazon accounts, just say, "Alexa, open Cortana." When you're speaking to Cortana you can check your emails, ask for the next event on your calendar or add items to your to-do list.

For now, the Cortana skill is limited because it's a public preview of what the full integration will be in the future.
