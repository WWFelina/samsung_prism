Google Assistant commands for your smart home setup
Philips Hue light bulb 2 - Google Home commands

Credit: Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority
If you happen to own a Philips Hue, Nest Thermostat or Samsung SmartThings device, you’re in luck — you can perform a number of different actions with these devices via Google Home commands. Below you’ll find a list of some of the commands you can use with Google Home to help automate your connected gadgets.

How to control Philips Hue lights (or lights connected through SmartThings)
Turn on or off a light: “Hey Google, turn on [light name]”, “Hey Google, turn off [light name]”.
Dim or brighten a light: “Hey Google, dim the [light name]”, “Hey Google, brighten the [light name]”.
Set a light brightness to a certain percentage: “Hey Google, set [light name] to 50%”.
Dim or brighten lights by a certain percentage: “Hey Google, dim/brighten [light name] by 50%”.
Change the color of a light: “Hey Google, turn [light name] green]”.
Turn on or off all lights in a room: “Hey Google, turn on lights in [room name]”, “Hey Google, turn off lights in [room name]”.
Turn on or off all lights: “Hey Google, turn on all of the lights”, “Hey Google, turn off all of the lights”.
How to control your Nest thermostat
Adjust the temperature: “Hey Google, make it warmer/cooler”, “Hey Google, raise/lower the temperature”, “Hey Google, raise/lower the temperature two degrees”, “Hey Google, set the temperature to 72 degrees”.
Switch to heating or cooling modes: “Hey Google, turn on heat/cooling”, “Hey Google, set the thermostat to cooling/heating”, “Hey Google, turn the thermostat to heat-cool mode”.
Set the mode and temperature: “Hey Google, set the heat to 68”, “Hey Google, set the air conditioning to 70”, “Hey Google, set [room name] thermostat to 72”.
Turn thermostat off: “Hey Google, turn off thermostat”.
Note: To turn the thermostat back on, you’ll need to specify a mode. You can say “Hey Google, turn on cooling/heating”, “Hey Google, turn on heat-cool”, “Hey Google, set the heat to 68”, “Hey Google set the air conditioning to 70”, etc.
Check the ambient temperature on the thermostat: “Hey Google, what’s the temperature inside?”.
Check what the thermostat is set to: “Hey Google, what’s the thermostat set to?”.
How to control Samsung SmartThings devices
Turn on or off all lights: “Hey Google, turn on all lights”, “Hey Google, turn off all lights”.
Turn on or off all switches: “Hey Google, turn on all switches”, “Hey Google, turn off all switches”.
Turn on or off everything in a room: “Hey Google, turn on everything”, “Hey Google, turn off everything”.
Note: Google Assistant recognizes “lights”, “switches”, and “outlets” as different kinds of devices. For example, if you say “Hey Google, turn on the lights”, it will turn on smart light bulbs but may not turn on smart switches that are connected to lamps or other lighting fixtures. To control those switches, add the word “light” to the name or nickname of the device.

How to control other smart home devices
If you installed an August Smart Lock on your door, you can control it by saying: “OK, Google, lock the front door”.
If you own a Logitech Harmony TV remote, you can say: “OK, Google, turn on the TV”, “OK, Google, turn the TV to the (specific) Channel”, or, “OK, Google, play channel 12”.
If you own a Nest Cam, you can show what it’s filming via a Chromecast TV by saying: “OK, Google, show [camera name]”, “Hey, Google, what’s on [camera name]?”, or “OK, Google, play [camera name] on [Chromecast name]”.
If you have a robot vacuum, try something like: “OK, Google, Clean the whole house”, or “Vacuum the kitchen”. This requires some initial set-up, so make sure your smart vacuum cleaner is connected to Google Assistant and you have everything ready.
There’s a plethora of other smart home devices. These include refrigerators, coffee makers, lamps, lawn mowers, and more. Many of these can also be controlled using Google Assistant.
Using IFTTT with Google Home
If you have a favorite app or service that’s not yet supported by Google Home, you might be in luck. Google Home is also compatible with IFTTT, the popular automation service. This means you can possibly hook up an app or service that doesn’t have support yet. For instance, Twitter doesn’t have Google Assistant support yet. However, you can still ask Google Assistant to post something to Twitter, as long as you have IFTTT set up. The same thing goes for other apps – want to add a task to Todoist? Just set it up in IFTTT, and Google Assistant will be able to add tasks whenever you ask it to.
